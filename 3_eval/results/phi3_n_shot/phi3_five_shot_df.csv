The instructions provided are for generating responses to given sentences based on sentiment analysis. The sentiment categories are 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral', with an additional 'other' category for contexts that don't fit the first three. The responses are structured as dictionaries with sentiment categories as keys and the sentiment value ('positive', 'negative', or 'neutral') as values.


For the first sentence, the sentiment is mixed, with a positive note on service and food but a negative on price. Therefore, the response is {'service':'positive','food':'positive','price':'negative'}.


In the second sentence, the sentiment is negative due to the comparison with other restaurants, indicating dissatisfaction with both food and price. The response is {'price':'negative','food':'negative'}.


The third sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards the food, specifically the martinis, despite the overall context not being fully clear. The response is {'food':'positive'}.


The fourth sentence is positive, suggesting the place is suitable for special occasions or dates. The response is {'other':'neutral'}.


The fifth sentence is positive, praising the quality of the food and the service. The response is {'food':'positive','service':'positive'}.


The sixth sentence is positive, emphasizing the freshness of the food. The response is {'food':'positive'}."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is to be broken down into three main aspects: service, food, and other relevant aspects such as price or ambiance. Each piece of feedback is to be evaluated and assigned a sentiment label of 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral', or 'other' if it does not fit into the first three categories.


For the first piece of feedback:

- Service: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.

- Food: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.

- Price: Negative, as the customer implies dissatisfaction with the price relative to the quality of food.


For the second piece of feedback:

- Food: Positive, as the customer appreciates the exotic martinis.

- Price: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.

- Other: Not applicable, as no other relevant aspects are discussed.


For the third piece of feedback:

- Other: Positive, as the customer views the place as suitable for a nice occasion or date.

- Food: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.

- Service: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.


For the fourth piece of feedback:

- Service: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.

- Other: Not applicable, as no other relevant aspects are discussed."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is broken down into different aspects such as service, food, price, and overall experience. Each piece of feedback is then assigned a sentiment label based on the expressed opinion.


For the first piece of feedback, the customer acknowledges the good service and food but also mentions that the prices are not justified by the quality. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for service and food, and 'negative' for price.


In the second feedback, the customer is critical of the food quality in comparison to other restaurants but shows interest in the pricing. This feedback is categorized as 'negative' for food and 'positive' for price.


The third feedback shows a specific appreciation for the food, particularly the gnocchi, which is described as melting in the mouth. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for food.


The fourth feedback praises the restaurant as a great spot for special occasions or dates, which is a general positive sentiment but does not specifically address service, food, or price. Therefore, it is categorized as 'neutral' under 'other'.


The last feedback is highly positive, commending both the food and the service. The food is described as ""terrific,"" and the service as ""classy, attentive, without being overbearing."" This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for both food and service."

It appears to be a random string of words and does not fit into the categories of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment regarding food, service, or any other aspect of a dining experience. Therefore, it is categorized as 'other' with a 'neutral' sentiment, as it does not express a clear opinion or feeling."

The instructions provided are clear and contain examples of how to assign sentiment labels to given statements. The sentiment labels are based on the expressed opinions or feelings about the service, food, price, and other aspects of a dining experience. The labels are 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral', and in some cases, 'other' is used to denote a sentiment that doesn't fit into the first two categories. The examples provided are consistent with these instructions and demonstrate the correct application of sentiment analysis to the given statements."

The instructions provided are to identify specific sentiments or categories within the given statements. The categories are'service', 'food', 'price', and 'other'. The statements are to be analyzed, and the relevant sentiment or category should be extracted and presented in a structured format, such as a dictionary in JSON.


For the first statement, the sentiment is positive towards both the service and the food, and there is no mention of price, so the appropriate categorization is:

- {'service':'positive','food':'positive','price':'neutral'}


However, since the instruction specifies to only include the categories'service', 'food', 'price', and 'other', and considering that there is no explicit mention of price, the final output would be:

- {'service':'positive','food':'positive'}


For the second statement, the sentiment is negative towards the food and price, and there is no mention of service or other categories, so the appropriate categorization is:

- {'food':'negative','price':'negative'}


Again, following the instruction to include only the specified categories, the output would be:

- {'food':'negative','price':'negative'}


For the third statement, the sentiment is positive towards the food, and there is no mention of service, price, or other categories, so the appropriate categorization is:

- {'food':'positive','other':'neutral'}


However, following the instruction, the output would be:

- {'food':'positive'}


For the fourth statement, there is no explicit sentiment towards service, food, price, or other categories, but there is a neutral sentiment towards other categories, so the appropriate categorization is:

- {'other':'neutral'}


Again, following the instruction, the output would be:

- {'other':'neutral'}


For the fifth statement, the sentiment is positive towards both the food and the service, and there is no mention of price or other categories, so the appropriate categorization is:

- {'food':'positive','service':'positive'}


Following the instruction, the output would be:

- {'"

The instructions provided are for evaluating statements regarding a dining experience, specifically focusing on the quality of food and service. The responses are structured in a JSON format, with keys representing aspects of the dining experience (e.g.,'service', 'food', 'price', 'other') and corresponding values indicating the sentiment expressed in the statement (e.g., 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral').


For the first statement, the sentiment is negative towards the food and price, but positive towards the service. This is reflected in the JSON response as {'service':'positive','food':'negative','price':'negative'}.


In the second statement, the sentiment is negative towards the food and price, but positive towards the exotic martinis. This is captured in the JSON response as {'food':'negative','price':'negative'}. However, the mention of ""exotic martinis"" suggests a positive aspect, which is not explicitly categorized in the provided keys, hence the 'other' key with a 'neutral' value.


The third statement expresses a positive sentiment towards the food and the overall dining experience, which is suitable for a nice occasion or date. This is represented in the JSON response as {'other':'neutral'}. The 'neutral' value under 'other' is used here because the statement does not specifically address food quality, service, or price, but rather the overall suitability of the place for an occasion.


The fourth statement is positive about both the food and the service, which is directly reflected in the JSON response as {'food':'positive','service':'positive'}.


Lastly, the statement indicates familiarity and positive sentiment towards real Indian food. This is captured in the JSON response as {'food':'positive'}, as it directly addresses the quality of the food."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is to be broken down into three main aspects: service, food, and other relevant categories such as price or ambiance. Each piece of feedback is to be evaluated and assigned a sentiment label of 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral', or 'other' if it does not fit into the predefined categories.


For the first piece of feedback, the customer acknowledges the good service and food but also mentions that the prices are not justified by the quality of the food. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for service and food, and 'negative' for price.


In the second piece of feedback, the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the food quality by comparing it to other restaurants. This feedback is categorized as 'negative' for both food and price.


The third piece of feedback is positive, as the customer would return to the restaurant for the exotic martinis. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for food.


The fourth piece of feedback is neutral, as it only comments on the restaurant being suitable for occasions or dates, without expressing a clear sentiment about the service, food, or other aspects.


The fifth piece of feedback is positive, praising the food and the service. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for both food and service.


The sixth piece of feedback is also positive, focusing solely on the great service provided by the staff. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for service."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is broken down into three main aspects: service, food, and other attributes. Each piece of feedback is then evaluated to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral/other.


For the first piece of feedback:

- The mention of ""great service"" and ""great food at a reasonable price"" clearly indicates a positive sentiment towards both service and food.

- The price is also mentioned in a positive light, suggesting satisfaction with the value for money.


For the second piece of feedback:

- The comparison to ""some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area"" implies dissatisfaction with the current establishment's food quality.

- The mention of ""prices"" without any positive context suggests a negative sentiment towards the price.


For the third piece of feedback:

- The desire to return for ""exotic martinis"" indicates a positive sentiment towards the food or drink offerings.


For the fourth piece of feedback:

- The statement ""Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date"" is a positive sentiment about the establishment's suitability for special events.


For the fifth piece of feedback:

- Describing the food as ""terrific"" and the service as ""classy, attentive, without being overbearing"" are all positive sentiments.


For the sixth piece of feedback:

- The mention of ""crab cakes delicious bbq rib perfect"" is a clear positive sentiment towards the food."

Here's a recipe that captures the essence of New Jersey's pizza:

**Ingredients:**

- 1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)
- 1 cup marinara sauce
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup sliced pepperoni
- 1/2 cup sliced green peppers
- 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1/2 cup sliced onions
- 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.

2. Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough onto a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet dusted with flour.

3. Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.

4. Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.

5. Distribute the pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions evenly over the cheese.

6. Drizzle the olive oil over the toppings and season with salt and pepper.

7. If you have a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven. If not, place the pizza on a baking sheet and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

8. Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately top it with fresh basil leaves.

9. Slice the pizza into wedges and serve hot.

Let's break it down:

- ""terrific"" and ""classy"" are positive sentiments regarding the food and service.
- ""attentive"" is also positive, describing the service.
- ""without being overbearing"" is a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, indicating the service was good without being intrusive.
- ""exotic martinis on the blackboard"" is a positive sentiment, suggesting a unique and appealing aspect of the food/drink offerings.
- ""really stood"" is unclear but could be interpreted as a positive sentiment if it refers to the establishment standing out.
- ""average"" is a negative sentiment, indicating mediocrity.
- ""beer list"" is neutral to positive, depending on the context of the beer list being extensive and appealing.

Given these sentiments, the overall sentiment can be categorized as mostly positive with a few neutral and negative aspects. Here's the categorization:

- food: positive
- service: positive
- average: negative
- beer list: neutral to positive (depending on context)

The other phrases like ""difference,"" ""comforting,"" ""better,"" ""really stood,"" and ""dynamic"" do not clearly fit into any of the categories without additional context."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is to be broken down into three main aspects: service, food, and other relevant aspects. The sentiment is to be classified as positive, negative, or neutral.


For the first piece of feedback:

- Service: Not mentioned, so neutral.

- Food: Not mentioned, so neutral.

- Price: Negative, as the customer implies dissatisfaction with the prices.


For the second piece of feedback:

- Price: Negative, as the customer is comparing unfavorably to other restaurants.

- Food: Negative, as the customer implies the food is not up to standard.


For the third piece of feedback:

- Food: Positive, as the customer specifically praises the martinis and sushi.


For the fourth piece of feedback:

- Other: Neutral, as the feedback is about the suitability of the restaurant for occasions or dates, which doesn't directly comment on service or food.


For the fifth piece of feedback:

- Food: Positive, as the customer describes the food as ""terrific.""

- Service: Positive, as the customer describes the service as ""classy, attentive, without being overbearing."""

The instructions provided require the creation of similar tasks with varying levels of complexity. The first task is straightforward, asking for a sentiment analysis of a given statement. The second task introduces more complexity by requiring the analysis of multiple aspects within a single statement, such as service, food, and price.


For the first instruction, the solution is simple:

- The sentiment towards the service is positive.

- The sentiment towards the food is positive.

- The sentiment towards the price is negative.


For the second instruction, the solution requires a more detailed breakdown:

- The sentiment towards the service is positive, indicating satisfaction with the attentiveness and professionalism.

- The sentiment towards the food is positive, suggesting that the quality of the food met or exceeded expectations.

- The sentiment towards the price is negative, implying that the customer felt the prices were not justified by the quality of the food.


The third instruction adds complexity by requiring the identification of sentiments that are not directly stated but implied, such as the desire for better food quality in relation to the prices.


The fourth instruction introduces a neutral sentiment, which requires recognizing that the statement is more of a general positive endorsement of the place without specific details about the food or service.


The fifth instruction is the most complex, as it requires the identification of a positive sentiment about a specific aspect of the food (exotic martinis) while also considering the overall context of the statement.


In all cases, the solutions are crafted to reflect the nuances of the customer's feedback, capturing both explicit and implicit sentiments."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is broken down into different aspects such as service, food, price, and overall experience. Each piece of feedback is then assigned a sentiment label based on the expressed opinion.


For the first piece of feedback, the customer acknowledges the good service and food but also mentions that the prices are not justified by the quality. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for service and food, and 'negative' for price.


In the second feedback, the customer is critical of the food quality in comparison to other restaurants but shows interest in the pricing. This feedback is categorized as 'negative' for food and 'negative' for price.


The third feedback shows a positive sentiment towards the food, specifically mentioning the exotic martinis. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for food.


The fourth feedback is neutral regarding the food but suggests the place is suitable for special occasions or dates. This feedback is categorized as 'neutral' for food and 'positive' for the overall experience.


The last feedback is highly positive, praising the food's flavor, the crust, and the sauce. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for food."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize the sentiment into predefined categories. The feedback is broken down into individual statements, each of which is then evaluated for sentiment regarding specific aspects such as'service', 'food', 'price', and 'other'. The sentiment is categorized as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'.


For the first statement, the customer acknowledges good service and food but implies that the prices are not justified by the quality, hence 'price' is categorized as 'negative' and both'service' and 'food' as 'positive'.


In the second statement, the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the food quality compared to other Chinese restaurants, thus 'food' is categorized as 'negative'. However, the mention of 'exotic martinis' suggests a positive aspect, so 'food' is recategorized as 'positive'.


The third statement is a clear endorsement of the place for special occasions, which does not directly comment on any specific aspect like 'food' or'service', so it is categorized as 'other' with a 'neutral' sentiment.


The fourth statement praises the food and service, which are both categorized as 'positive'.


The last statement specifically compliments the selection of rolls and the quality of the crab, which is a direct comment on the 'food', hence categorized as 'positive'."

The instructions provided require the creation of similar tasks with varying levels of complexity. The first task is straightforward, asking for a sentiment analysis of a given statement. The second task introduces more complexity by adding constraints to the sentiment analysis, such as identifying specific aspects (e.g., service, food, price) and their associated sentiments.


For the first instruction, the sentiment analysis is direct and simple, with the response categorizing the sentiment as either positive, negative, or neutral based on the content of the statement.


In the second instruction, the task becomes more challenging as it requires the assistant to not only determine the overall sentiment but also to break down the sentiment into specific aspects mentioned in the statement. This requires a more nuanced understanding of the text and the ability to discern subtle differences in sentiment related to different aspects of the service or product.


The third instruction adds another layer of complexity by including a neutral sentiment, which requires the assistant to recognize when a statement does not fit into the positive or negative categories but still conveys a meaningful sentiment.


The fourth instruction introduces the concept of exotic items as a positive sentiment, which requires the assistant to understand that the mention of something unique or unusual can be perceived as a positive aspect.


The fifth instruction is a straightforward positive sentiment regarding the food, requiring the assistant to identify and categorize the sentiment accurately.


The sixth instruction is neutral, as it does not express a sentiment about the food, service, or price but rather comments on the appropriateness of the location for a special event.


The seventh instruction is positive, focusing solely on the sentiment related to the food aspect of the statement.


The eighth instruction is positive, with the sentiment being about the overall experience at the spot, which could imply a positive sentiment about the place as a whole.


The ninth instruction is positive, with the sentiment being about the food quality, specifically mentioning the sandwiches.


Each instruction is crafted to be independent and self-contained, ensuring that the assistant can provide a solution based solely on the information given in the instruction without needing additional context."

The last statement ""service excellent wait get lot price"" seems to be a bit unclear due to the presence of typos and grammatical errors. However, the sentiment towards the service being excellent can be inferred. The mention of ""get lot price"" could imply a negative sentiment towards the price, but since it's not clearly stated and is overshadowed by the positive remark about the service, the overall sentiment towards the price is not explicitly negative. Therefore, the sentiment related to the price is not included in the output."

The instructions provided are clear and contain examples of how to categorize sentiments into predefined categories. The first instruction is straightforward, asking to categorize a given sentiment into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. The second instruction adds complexity by requiring the categorization of sentiments into multiple categories simultaneously, as well as identifying a sentiment that does not fit into the provided categories.


For the first instruction, the solution is direct and involves assigning the sentiment to one of the three categories based on its content. The second instruction requires a more nuanced approach, as it involves multiple sentiments that need to be categorized into different categories. The additional task of identifying a sentiment that does not fit into the provided categories adds another layer of complexity.


The third instruction introduces a new dimension by asking for categorization into a broader 'other' category, which could include sentiments that are not explicitly positive or negative but still relevant to the context. This requires a broader interpretation of the sentiment's implications.


The solutions provided for each instruction are concise and directly map the sentiment to the appropriate category, demonstrating an understanding of the sentiment's nuances and the ability to apply the given categories accurately."

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is to be broken down into three main aspects: service, food, and other relevant aspects such as price or ambiance. Each piece of feedback is to be evaluated and assigned a sentiment value of 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' for each of the specified aspects. Additionally, if a piece of feedback does not clearly pertain to one of the specified aspects, it should be categorized as 'other' with a 'neutral' sentiment.


For the first piece of feedback:
- Service: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.
- Food: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.
- Price: Negative, as the customer implies dissatisfaction with the price relative to the food quality.

For the second piece of feedback:
- Food: Positive, as the customer praises the exotic martinis.
- Price: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.
- Other: Not applicable, as the feedback is specifically about food.

For the third piece of feedback:
- Other: Positive, as the customer describes the place as great for occasions or dates.
- Food: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.
- Service: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.

For the fourth piece of feedback:
- Food: Positive, as the customer describes the food as terrific.
- Service: Positive, as the customer describes the service as classy and attentive.
- Price: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.

For the fifth piece of feedback:
- Food: Positive, as the customer mentions the food was well done.
- Service: Not mentioned, so it's neutral.
- Other: Not applicable, as the feedback is specifically about the food."

It's a dish that showcases the chef's ability to bring out the natural flavors of the fish through a perfect blend of spices and cooking techniques. The codfish is typically seasoned with a mix of herbs and spices that complement its delicate taste, then roasted to achieve a crispy exterior while maintaining a moist and tender interior. The dish is often served with a side of vegetables or a light sauce that enhances the overall dining experience. Given your positive feedback on the food and service, I would highly recommend trying the Black Roasted Codfish for a memorable evening."

The instructions provided are clear and contain examples of how to categorize text into specific sentiment-related categories. The first instruction is straightforward, asking to categorize a given statement into'service', 'food', or 'price'. The second instruction adds complexity by requiring the categorization of sentiment within the context of a comparison to other restaurants, which involves understanding nuanced language and implied sentiment. The third instruction focuses on identifying a positive sentiment related to a specific aspect of the food. The fourth instruction is neutral, requiring categorization based on the context of the statement rather than explicit sentiment. The fifth instruction involves recognizing a positive sentiment related to the food's quality. The sixth instruction is similar to the third but focuses on the overall suitability of the place for social occasions. The seventh instruction requires identifying positive sentiment related to the food's texture and taste."

The instruction requires the extraction of sentiment from a given text snippet, focusing on three aspects: service, food, and other relevant categories. The sentiment is to be classified as positive, negative, or neutral.


For the first sentence, the sentiment is negative towards the price and food, as the customer implies dissatisfaction with the value for money and the quality of the food.


In the second sentence, the sentiment is positive towards the food, as the customer expresses a desire to return for the exotic martinis, which implies a positive experience with the food or beverage offerings.


The third sentence does not directly mention food or service, but it implies a positive sentiment towards the place as a whole, suitable for occasions or dates, which can be categorized as 'other' sentiment.


The fourth sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards both the food and the service, as the customer describes the food as ""terrific"" and the service as ""classy, attentive, without being overbearing.""


The last sentence has a negative sentiment towards the service, as the customer describes it as ""dreadfully slow,"" despite a ""half full smile,"" which suggests a forced or polite reaction to the service."

Fried pork dumplings, also known as ""jiaozi,"" are typically made with a filling of ground pork, ginger, scallions, and seasonings wrapped in a thin dough skin. They are usually served with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil.

Orange fried rice, on the other hand, is a sweet and savory dish made with cooked rice, vegetables, eggs, and orange segments. The orange segments add a citrusy flavor and vibrant color to the dish. This dish is often seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil, and other spices to enhance its taste.

Both dishes are delicious and can be a great addition to a meal at a Chinese restaurant. They offer a variety of flavors and textures, making them enjoyable for many people."

The instruction requires the extraction of sentiment from the given statements, focusing on three aspects: service, food, and price. The sentiment should be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Additionally, for the last statement, the sentiment should be determined based on the perceived value for money, which is a nuanced aspect of the price sentiment.


1. ""Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.""

   - Service: Positive

   - Food: Positive

   - Price: Positive


2. ""I can understand the prices if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area.""

   - Price: Neutral (The statement is not directly positive or negative but implies that the prices are acceptable if the food quality is higher.)

   - Food: Negative (The comparison to other restaurants suggests that the food is not up to par.)


3. ""Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.""

   - Other: Neutral (This statement is more about the ambiance or suitability for an occasion rather than the service, food, or price.)


4. ""The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing.""

   - Food: Positive

   - Service: Positive


5. ""Eleven bucks get gigantic burrito tacos margarita dessert""

The instructions provided are for generating responses to given sentences that evaluate certain aspects of a service or product. The responses are structured in a JSON format, where each key corresponds to an aspect being evaluated (e.g.,'service', 'food', 'price', 'other') and the associated value is either 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' based on the sentiment expressed in the sentence.


For the first sentence, the customer acknowledges the good service and food but also mentions that the prices are not justified by the quality, which is why the sentiment for 'price' and 'food' is 'negative', while'service' is 'positive'.


In the second sentence, the customer expresses a willingness to return for a specific feature (exotic martinis), which implies a 'positive' sentiment towards the 'food' aspect.


The third sentence is a straightforward positive statement about the place being suitable for special occasions or dates, which is why 'other' is marked as 'neutral' since it doesn't directly relate to service, food, or price.


The fourth sentence praises both the quality of the food and the manner of service, which is why both 'food' and'service' are marked as 'positive'.


Lastly, the customer's statement about wanting to return because of the food quality is a clear 'positive' sentiment towards the 'food'."

The instructions provided are for generating responses to given sentences based on sentiment analysis. The sentiment categories are 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral', with an additional 'other' category for contexts that don't fit the first three. The responses are structured in a JSON format, where each sentence is associated with a sentiment label.


For the first sentence, the sentiment is positive due to the mention of ""great service and great food at a reasonable price.""


In the second sentence, the sentiment is negative because the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the food quality compared to other Chinese restaurants.


The third sentence has a positive sentiment as the customer shows interest in returning, specifically for the ""exotic martinis.""


The fourth sentence is neutral, as it simply states a fact about the place being suitable for occasions or dates without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.


The fifth sentence has both positive sentiments regarding the quality of the food and the service.


Lastly, the sixth sentence is positive because the customer describes the duck confit as ""solid,"" indicating a good quality dish, despite a minor comment about the base reference."

Here is a simple recipe to make it at home:

Ingredients:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups Italian breadcrumbs
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 lemon, for serving

1. Start by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness. This will ensure that they cook evenly.

2. In a shallow dish, mix the flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.

3. In another shallow dish, beat the eggs.

4. In a third shallow dish, combine the Italian breadcrumbs.

5. Dredge each chicken breast first in the flour, then in the beaten eggs, and finally in the breadcrumbs. Make sure to press the breadcrumbs onto the chicken to ensure they stick.

6. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

7. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.

8. Remove the chicken from the skillet and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.

9. Serve the chicken Milanese with a wedge of lemon on the side.

Enjoy your homemade Chicken Milanese!"

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is broken down into different aspects such as service, food, price, and overall experience. Each piece of feedback is then assigned a sentiment value of 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral', or a combination of these based on the content of the feedback.


For the first piece of feedback, the customer acknowledges the good service and food but also mentions that the prices are not justified by the quality. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for service and food, and 'negative' for price.


In the second piece of feedback, the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the food quality by comparing it unfavorably to other restaurants. This feedback is categorized as 'negative' for both food and price, as the implication is that the food is not worth the price.


The third piece of feedback is positive, as the customer expresses a desire to return to the restaurant, specifically mentioning the appeal of the exotic martinis. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for food.


The fourth piece of feedback is also positive, as the customer describes the restaurant as a great spot for special occasions or dates. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for the overall experience.


The final piece of feedback is positive, as the customer praises the quality of the food, wine, and desserts. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for food."

The instruction requires the extraction of sentiment from a complex sentence, which involves multiple aspects such as food quality, service, clientele behavior, and staff attitude. The sentiment for each aspect must be determined and categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.


- Food: The phrase ""The food was terrific"" clearly indicates a positive sentiment towards the food quality.

- Service: The description ""service however peg two quality food horrible bartenders"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the service, particularly mentioning the bartenders' quality.

- Clientele Behavior: ""clientele part rowdy commuters"" implies a negative sentiment as it describes the clientele as rowdy.

- Staff Attitude: ""could explain bad attitudes staff"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the staff attitude.

- Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment is mixed, but the negative aspects seem to carry more weight in the context of the sentence.


Given the complexity of the sentence and the multiple aspects mentioned, the sentiment for each aspect is as follows:

- Food: Positive

- Service: Negative

- Clientele Behavior: Negative

- Staff Attitude: Negative

- Overall Sentiment: Negative (due to the predominance of negative aspects)"

The instructions provided are to analyze customer feedback and categorize it into specific sentiment categories. The feedback is broken down into different aspects such as service, food, price, and overall experience. Each piece of feedback is then assigned a sentiment value of 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral', or a combination of these based on the content of the feedback.


For the first piece of feedback, the customer acknowledges the good service and food but also mentions that the prices are not justified by the quality. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for service and food, and 'negative' for price.


In the second piece of feedback, the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the food quality compared to other restaurants but shows interest in the drinks offered. This feedback is categorized as 'negative' for food and 'positive' for the drinks.


The third piece of feedback is entirely positive, with the customer expressing a desire to return to the restaurant for special occasions. This feedback is categorized as 'positive'.


The fourth piece of feedback praises the food quality and the service style. This feedback is categorized as 'positive' for both food and service.

The instructions provided are clear and contain examples of how to categorize sentiments into predefined categories. The first instruction is straightforward, requiring the categorization of a single sentence into'service', 'food', or 'price'. The second instruction adds complexity by including multiple sentences, each requiring categorization into'service', 'food', 'price', or 'other'. The 'other' category is used for sentiments that do not fit into the first three categories.


In the first set of examples, the sentences are analyzed as follows:

- ""Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening."" This sentence contains positive sentiments about'service', 'food', and 'price', so it is categorized into all three.

- ""I can understand the prices if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area."" This sentence expresses a negative sentiment about 'food' and a conditional positive sentiment about 'price', so it is categorized into 'food' and 'price'.

- ""I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard."" This sentence expresses a positive sentiment about 'food', specifically'martinis', so it is categorized into 'food'.

- ""Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date."" This sentence does not express a sentiment about'service', 'food', or 'price', but it does suggest a positive experience, so it is categorized into 'other'.

- ""The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing."" This sentence contains positive sentiments about both 'food' and'service', so it is categorized into both.

- ""Chicken falafel platters nondescript combinations fresh leaf salad."" This sentence contains a positive sentiment about 'food', so it is categorized into 'food'."

The instructions provided are clear and contain a set of examples that demonstrate the task of identifying sentiment within given statements. The solutions are straightforward, with each statement being categorized into one or more sentiment categories such as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'. Additionally, there is a fourth category 'other' which is used when a statement does not fit into the first three categories.
